DEBian Remote Install Service

Shell helper to transparently run commands on a remote system.

The only requirements are:

- On the remote, there must be running something like a
  very minimal Debian system with all needed tools.

- Run DebRIS on the remote

- Define how the local DebRIS reaches the remote DebRIS.


Then you can run commands transparantly to the remote, just by typing "debris " (without the qotes) in front of the command.  DebRIS also supports crossing a "sudo" or "chroot" barrier easlily.

Command list see: ./debris help
